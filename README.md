# Chance-of-Admission
In this project, we will use the Admission chance dataset in csv format to forecast the chances of students being admitted to a university based on a variety of academic performance measures.
 To achieve the most accurate results, we will go through numerous procedures such as data preprocessing, train-test, and so on to train a linear regression model, generate predictions, and analyse its performance.
